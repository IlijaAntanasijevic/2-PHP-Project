# E-commerce web app (Shoes shop)

## Single Page Web App, using pure PHP


#### Second PHP Project
Improvement of procedural PHP, creating a customized database

Creating an e-commerce site, with the possibility for authorized users to buy the product, it is also possible to leave comments and ratings in case the product has been purchased.

Worked with PDO and checked for SQL injections, as well as form validation on the client and server side. Pagination, sorting, and filtering on the server side.

The entire content is in the database or in the config file. It is possible to send emails using a PHP mailer.

It is possible to block the user and watch their activity. A text file was used to complete it.

It has an admin panel with all CRUD operations for customizing the app's content

More information is available on the author page in the documentation.
